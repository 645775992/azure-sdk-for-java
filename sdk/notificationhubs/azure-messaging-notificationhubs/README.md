# Azure Notification Hubs SDK for JavaScript

Azure Notification Hubs provide a scaled-out push engine that enables you to send notifications to any platform (Apple, Amazon Kindle, Android, Baidu, Web, Windows, etc.) from any back-end (cloud or on-premises). Notification Hubs works great for both enterprise and consumer scenarios. Here are a few example scenarios:

- Send breaking news notifications to millions with low latency.
- Send location-based coupons to interested user segments.
- Send event-related notifications to users or groups for media/sports/finance/gaming applications.
- Push promotional contents to applications to engage and market to customers.
- Notify users of enterprise events such as new messages and work items.
- Send codes for multi-factor authentication.

## Troubleshooting

### Enable client logging

Azure SDK for Java offers a consistent logging story to help aid in troubleshooting application errors and expedite
their resolution. The logs produced will capture the flow of an application before reaching the terminal state to help
locate the root issue. View the [logging][logging] wiki for guidance about enabling logging.
